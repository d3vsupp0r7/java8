# Generics
Generic programming means writing code that can be reused for objects of many
different types.

## Generic Class
A generic class is a class with one or more type variables

The Java library uses the variable E for the element type of a
collection, K and V for key and value types of a table, and T (and the neighboring
letters U and S, if necessary) for “any type at all”.

The type variables are used throughout the class definition to specify method
return types and the types of fields and local variables

In other words, the generic class acts as a factory for ordinary classes
